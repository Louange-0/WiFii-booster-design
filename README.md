# WiFii-booster-design
Designing a Wi-Fi signal booster or antenna arrays can be a complex engineering task that goes beyond a simple code snippet. It involves hardware design, antenna theory, and sometimes even legal considerations due to regulatory restrictions on signal amplification. Below, We provided a basic example of how  Arduino or Raspberry Pi is used to control a motorized directional antenna for adjusting signal direction. This is a simplified example and does not constitute a full-fledged signal booster:

Components Needed:

Arduino or Raspberry Pi
Motorized antenna (e.g., a servo-controlled directional antenna)
Wi-Fi module (e.g., ESP8266 or ESP32 for Arduino)
Power supply for the antenna (if required)
Mounting hardware for the antenna
